# Minesweeper Console Game
This is a terminal-based implementation of the classic Minesweeper game. Players reveal cells on a 5x5 grid, trying to avoid hidden mines while uncovering clues about their locations. The game dynamically updates the board as players make guesses, and it ends when all safe cells are revealed or a mine is triggered. This project uses Python for all game logic, user interaction, and console display.
<br><br>

## Features
- **Randomized Mines Placement:** Players choose the number of mines (1â€“25), which are randomly placed on the board.
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Players can reveal cells and recursively uncover safe areas if no mines are nearby.
- **Visual Board Updates:** The grid updates in real-time as cells are revealed, displaying counts of adjacent mines.
- **Winning and Losing Conditions:** The game ends either when a mine is triggered (loss) or when all safe cells are revealed (win).
- **Error Handling:** Includes input validation to prevent invalid or duplicate moves.
